# api_for_weather_nerds

Welcome to my little project. This is a small test project to summarize my knowledge from a year as a backend developer.

Api_For_Weather_neards - This is a small api based on Fastapi in python, its task is to check the weather, seemingly nothing special, however, I want the api to be able to be put on anything via docker without any problem. So that it would have the possibility of login, session. Place an order "Check the weather" at the time, a given location and save this information to PostSQL DB.
The data would be retrieved using two public api's, a field locator based on Keyword and a strikta weather api. 

Curent progress in Dev branch
